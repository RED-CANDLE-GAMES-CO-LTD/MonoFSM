## Overview

MonoFSM is a comprehensive Finite State Machine (FSM) framework for Unity, designed to simplify the implementation of complex game behaviors and logic. The framework provides a visual and modular approach to designing state machines, making it easier to create, debug, and maintain game systems.
[Nine Sols](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/) is the first project to use this framework, and it has been developed and tested in the context of that game.
